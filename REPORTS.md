1. Reflection on Betting Strategy Simulation:
   
  Through this experiment, I explored several betting strategies, including Flat Betting, Stop-Loss, Random Betting, and Martingale, and observed how they perform under repeated   trials. The exercise taught me several key lessons about decision-making, risk, and strategy design:
  Understanding Risk vs. Reward
  Some strategies, like Martingale, can offer the possibility of small gains but carry the potential for catastrophic losses.
  Simpler strategies, such as Flat Betting or Stop-Loss, tend to produce more stable outcomes with less risk.
  Importance of Risk Management
  Even strategies that seem profitable in the short term can fail under extreme scenarios.
  Setting limits or “caps” on bets dramatically reduces the likelihood of ruin, highlighting the value of thoughtful constraints in planning and execution.
  Randomness and Variability Matter
  Outcomes are inherently uncertain, and small differences in strategy can lead to large differences in results over time.
  Understanding variability is as important as understanding average outcomes.
  Parameter Tuning Can Change Results
  Adjusting strategy parameters, like the betting cap for Martingale, significantly affects performance.
  Careful analysis and optimization are critical to balancing potential gains against possible losses.
  Quantitative Thinking and Analysis
  This experiment reinforced how simulations can help test hypotheses and understand the consequences of decisions before taking real-world actions.
  Visualizing outcomes and analyzing patterns provides insights that numbers alone might not reveal.
  Overall, the exercise strengthened my understanding of how risk, randomness, and strategy interact. It also highlighted the importance of careful planning, disciplined 
  execution, and evidence-based decision-making skills that are crucial in quantitative and analytical fields like finance, trading, and algorithmic problem-solving.
