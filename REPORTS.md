Research and reports

1. Reflection on Betting Strategy Simulation:
   
  Through this experiment, I explored several betting strategies, including Flat Betting, Stop-Loss, Random Betting, and Martingale, and observed how they perform under repeated   trials. The exercise taught me several key lessons about decision-making, risk, and strategy design:
  
  Understanding Risk vs. Reward
  Some strategies, like Martingale, can offer the possibility of small gains but carry the potential for catastrophic losses.
  Simpler strategies, such as Flat Betting or Stop-Loss, tend to produce more stable outcomes with less risk.
  
  Importance of Risk Management
  Even strategies that seem profitable in the short term can fail under extreme scenarios.
  Setting limits or “caps” on bets dramatically reduces the likelihood of ruin, highlighting the value of thoughtful constraints in planning and execution.
  
  Randomness and Variability Matter
  Outcomes are inherently uncertain, and small differences in strategy can lead to large differences in results over time.
  Understanding variability is as important as understanding average outcomes.
  
  Parameter Tuning Can Change Results
  Adjusting strategy parameters, like the betting cap for Martingale, significantly affects performance.
  Careful analysis and optimization are critical to balancing potential gains against possible losses.
  
  Quantitative Thinking and Analysis
  This experiment reinforced how simulations can help test hypotheses and understand the consequences of decisions before taking real-world actions.
  Visualizing outcomes and analyzing patterns provides insights that numbers alone might not reveal.
  
  Overall, the exercise strengthened my understanding of how risk, randomness, and strategy interact. It also highlighted the importance of careful planning, disciplined 
  execution, and evidence-based decision-making skills that are crucial in quantitative and analytical fields like finance, trading, and algorithmic problem-solving.


2. Report on Market Maker:

   Project Summary:
   In this project, I built a simple market-making simulation. A market maker sets buy and sell prices for a stock while trying to manage risk and earn profit. The program        simulates random price movements and trades from other market participants.
   
   Key Learnings:
   I learned how a market maker uses spreads and inventory limits to balance profit and risk.
   I implemented a risk adjustment so that holding too many shares changes quotes, reducing potential losses.
   I tracked profit and loss (P&L) over time and computed the Sharpe ratio to measure return relative to risk.
   This project helped me understand how randomness in prices affects strategy performance and how to optimize decisions in a noisy environment.
   
   Reflection:
   This simulation taught me how quantitative rules can guide trading decisions. It also showed me the importance of measuring risk and reward, which is critical in real          financial markets. The project combined programming, probability, and strategy in a way that mirrors real-world market making.

3. Report on Blackjack "optimizer" :

   Project Summary:
   I simulated a simple Blackjack game to study different playing strategies. The player uses a threshold strategy, hitting until reaching a certain hand value, while the         dealer follows fixed rules. I ran many games to estimate the expected profit for each threshold.
   
   Key Learnings:
   I learned to model random processes in games and how probability affects expected outcomes.
   I analyzed how changing the hit threshold impacts risk and reward.
   The simulation helped me understand expected value and strategy optimization in a clear, measurable way.
   I visualized results to see which thresholds gave the best average profit, making it easier to compare strategies.
   
   Reflection:
   This project showed how simulations can guide decision-making under uncertainty. I learned to quantify risk and reward, explore multiple strategies, and understand why         certain thresholds are better, which is similar to trading and probabilistic reasoning in finance.
  
4. Report on Combinatorics Solver:

   Project Summary:
   This project explored exact probabilities and Monte Carlo simulations for dice and coin games. I computed exact outcomes using combinatorics and also estimated                 probabilities through random simulations. I also calculated the expected value of simple coin games.
   
   Key Learnings:
   I learned to calculate exact probabilities using combinations and to simulate them with random trials.
   I compared analytical results with simulations to see how well Monte Carlo methods approximate true probabilities.
   The project strengthened my understanding of expected value, randomness, and probabilistic modeling.
   I practiced translating mathematical ideas into working code, making abstract concepts concrete.
   
   Reflection:
   This project highlighted the power of simulations to estimate probabilities when exact calculations are too complex. It also reinforced my idea of quantitative                 reasoning and its importance.
